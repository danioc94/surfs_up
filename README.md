# Surfs up Challenge

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this repository is to analyze weather data for the city Oahu, Hawaii and determine how feasible it might be to open a surf shop focusing on climate temperature for the months of June and December. To run our analysis we use SQLAlchemy and SQLite to fetch and query our data and then use Pandas functions to obatin a summary statistics.

## Results
After obtaining and filtering our data we obatin the following results:

- The month of June has slightly higher temperatures than the month of December with an average of 74.94 Fahrenheit Degrees.
- The month of December has slightly lower temperatures than the month of June with an average temperature of 71.04 Fahrenheit Degrees.
- The month of December has a higher Standard Deviation indicating the lower and higher temperature are more wide spread on the normal distribution.

## Summary

The overall temperatures for the months of June and December show that the there is an average temperature above 70 degrees. This could indicate that the year around data will all be averaging these same temperatures which is great to have a surf shop open. As long as temperatures are high and precipitations are low, the more chances a new Surf Shop will be succesful.
